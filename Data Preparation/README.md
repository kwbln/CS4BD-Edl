The sign up here link is broken but if you search the 5 courses in Kaggle you will find them easily.
Fork her repositories and send me one or five linkes to your kaggle solutions.

B) Play around with Trifacta! Import your favourite dataset where you might have inserted some
errors before. Upload one PDF where you show me screenshots, explain the problems with the dataset
and show the recipies that solved the problems.

# Streaming Kafka

1. Read Kafka Messaging and the links to the Kafka Libraries (e.g. in Python) to get ready for the next exercise.
Programm (!) two Kafka Producers writing to the same topic (using Java, Python, etc.)
Producer A writes even numbers every second, the other Producer B writes off numbers every two seconds to the topic.
Your consumer C reads the numbers and prints them with the origin A or B.
In practice: You start the e.g. three Python Scripts independently (not implementing the fork / concurrency etc. by hand)! (First you strt the zookeper and the Kafka server)

2. Read the entire Documentation of Apache Kafka.
What is new / different about Kafka Streams? Write to paragraphs.

3. Watch the AlphaGo Movie on NetFlix (no proof needed :-)

I expect you send me one PDF File containing exercise #1. + #2. and a "yes" for #3.!

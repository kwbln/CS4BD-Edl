# NoSQL

1. Key/Value DB

- Install a Key / Value DB as Redis (requires either UNIX make or the Docker image) and run the redis-benchmark! [file #1]
- Play with the Shell. Do some CRUDs for the basic datastructures (do not use messages and streaming yet). The basic datatructures are: key/Value, Hashes, Lists, Sets / sorted Sets. Save it like a text protocol or even screenshots in the worst case. [file #2]

2. Do the same as above (doing CRUD in a Shell) for either a GraphDB (e.g. neo4j) or a DocumentDB (e.g. Elastic (!) or MongoDB). Or do everything in a  Multimodel DB (as ArangoDB which has a nice Docker image too) [file #3]

3. Code CRUD Ops against the Key-Value DB AND one of the DBs mentioned in Nr.2 in  any language you like (Python?!). (If using Redis only against one data structure is ok).
